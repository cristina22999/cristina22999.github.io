### Hello! 

My name is Cristina Poncela Cubeiro. I am a mathematician and avid coder. 

I am originally from Spain, but studied university in the UK and now live in Italy. I love the beach, travelling and gymming.

I learned how to code about one and a half years ago, and kind of stumbled into it. I have built an application in React-Native, 2 applications in Flutter, and a Computer Vision Machine Learning model in TensorFlow. I also have experience in Python, and have built several websites (both from scratch or otherwise). 

::: tip Favourite languages:
Python and Flutter
:::

::: warning Least favourites:
R and Flutter

I love speaking about tech and science, so do reach out if you would like to get in touch!
